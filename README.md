"a tool to silence those who would lure children from their homes to fight a pointless war"

The free world is losing the cyber battle taking place on social media, against the terrorists who claim the name 'Islamic State'.

They are recruiting our children, friends & family, turning them into 'poison pills', ordinary citizens walking amongst us, with orders to bring destruction and chaos in the name of the islamic state.

There is no reason for this. We are much better with technology than they are. Short of eastern Europe, we have the best hackers on the planet.

The problem was we were not thinking asymmetrically enough. With this tool, now we are.

This tool will allow you to link your twitter account to the command line interface of your system.
When running, it searches a designated accounts tweets for a special #hashtag. When found the tool finds the target @userName in that special tweet, and reports that user for spam

Simple idea, but the power is in numbers. The more people linked around the globe, the more voices speaking democracy's message, the stronger & swifter the cannon's effect will be.
